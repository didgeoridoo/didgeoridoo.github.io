After redirecting my own domain to [Fresh Tilled Soil](http://www.freshtilledsoil.com) for nearly a year out of sheer embarrassment (no I won't show you my old site; use [the Wayback Machine](http://archive.org) if you're so curious), the time has come. Welcome to the new kayt.es! 

I'll be blogging here at [GK.write()](/blog), and cross-posting interesting & relevant things over at [my company blog](http://www.freshtilledsoil.com/blog). Stay over there if you'd like to keep it strictly professional.
