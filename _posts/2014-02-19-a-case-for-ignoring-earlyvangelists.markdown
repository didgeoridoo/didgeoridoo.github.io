The [Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/) mantra of pursuing and designing for the ["earlyvangelist"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earlyvangelist) is a destructive and lazy habit for a designer. 

Earlyvangelists are users who are aware of the problem that you're trying to solve, and often have already hacked together a solution for it. This should be a red flag, not a bullseye. If you focus on these highly atypical, highly-motivated users during your design process, you will miss opportunities to build an intuitive, usable product for the great majority.

This issue keeps coming up in our UX process at [Fresh Tilled Soil](http://www.freshtilledsoil.com), with clients ranging from just-funded startups to major corporations. The product owner always wants to introduce our design team to their most vocal early-adopters. 

I'd rather meet the people who don't give a shit, so I can figure out how to make them care.

During our design review this afternoon with a corporate client in the business intelligence (BI) industry, the product owner made the leap on her own after seeing our first-round wireframes: "If we build something that's this easy to understand, we could sell it way beyond our current customers!"

Up to that point, they'd conceived of the primary user as a data analyst, or perhaps a highly-motivated middle manager. These power users would have been insanely difficult to satisfy, because of the one word that should still strike fear into the heart of B2B analytics companies: [Excel](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/).

Here's a secret: you will never win over the Excel wizards, with their ergonomic keyboards and their short sleeve button-downs. They will export your data from your tool, writing a screen-scraping script in VBA if they have to. They will slice and dice and PivotTable the shit out of your data. Unless you're offering something truly unique (like proprietary algorithms), you don't have a product for these guys.

But Excel wizards are a tiny fraction of the population. A frightening number of people treat Excel like a literal [paper spreadsheet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet#Paper_spreadsheets), typing numbers in columns and *summing them with a hand calculator*. These are the people you should be designing for. Lord knows they need it.
