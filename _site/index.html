        <h2>Scientific management is anti-human.</h2>
        <p>I'm working on a book exploring how organizational structure and management techniques crush productivity and happiness, and what we can do about it. Follow my <a href="/blog">progress</a>.</p>
        <p>How can we visualize and build a new type of organization that turns human effort into happiness and value? Are legacy companies doomed, or can they adapt with the right leadership? If you'd like to contribute your thoughts, <a href="/contact">get in touch.</a></p>
