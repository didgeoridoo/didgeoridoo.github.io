        <p>I'm a digital product designer. I turn pixels and bits into experiences that change lives in small ways.</p>
        <p>I specialize in building tools for healthcare, education, and productivity management. I design for all platforms, but tend to focus these days on responsive web applications.</p>
        <p>I'm the Director of UX Strategy at <a href="http://www.freshtilledsoil.com">Fresh Tilled Soil</a>, the best group of UX/UI maniacs in the world. My job is to lead the design of human-centered products that make our clients successful by making their customers happy. Come join us.</p>

        <h2>Scientific management is anti-human.</h2>
        <p>I'm working on a book exploring how organizational structure and management techniques crush productivity and happiness, and what we can do about it. <a href="/blog">Follow my progress</a>.</p>
        <p>How can we visualize and build a new type of organization that turns human effort into happiness and value? Are legacy companies doomed, or can they adapt with the right leadership? If you'd like to contribute your thoughts, <a href="/contact">get in touch.</a></p>
